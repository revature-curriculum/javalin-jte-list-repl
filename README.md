## JTE List Answer
---
### Description
In this lab we will cover how to iterate through an ArrayList of Strings using JTE.

---
### Steps

1. In src -> main -> java -> Main.java, create a String ArrayList that will contain names of sea creatures. Add at least 4 sea creatures to your list.
2. On the same class, create a new route and handler for your list of sea creatures.
3. In src -> main -> jte, add your implementation in the seaCreatures.jte file where you will iterate through your list with a for loop. Make sure to add the imports and parameters required. Add your for loop inside the body tag.
